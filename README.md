# Cel Shade Lit
A custom made Unity URP cel shader that supports multiple lights and shadows.

For implementation details see [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/gw31oF9qITw).

## Future Plans
The cel shader in its current state is beautiful, but basic. Below are a few things planned for future releases:
- Normal maps
- Baked lighting
- Baked shadows
- Packaging of Rim Shading variables into the Smoothness Map
- Better handling of attenuations
- and much more
